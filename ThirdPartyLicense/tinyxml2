Thanks very much to everyone who sends suggestions, bugs, ideas, and 
encouragement. It all helps, and makes this project fun.

The original TinyXML-1 has many contributors, who all deserve thanks
in shaping what is a very successful library. Extra thanks to Yves
Berquin and Andrew Ellerton who were key contributors.

TinyXML-2 grew from that effort. Lee Thomason is the original author
of TinyXML-2 (and TinyXML-1) but TinyXML-2 has been and is being improved
by many contributors.

Thanks to John Mackay at http://john.mackay.rosalilastudio.com for the TinyXML-2 logo!
